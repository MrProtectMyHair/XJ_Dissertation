感谢您参加本次实验。

这里一共有12组音频。每一组音频中有且仅有一段由真人录制，其他均为合成语音。
希望您能在听完每一组音频后给予每段音频的自然程度一个评分，
分数从1到5，1代表完全不自然，5代表非常自然，以此类推。
评完分之后，还需要您选出每一组中您认为的由人类录制的音频，
并将评分以及您的判断记录于提供的Results.xlsx中
如果能在Comments里面留下自己对音频的评价就更好啦

There are 12 sets of audio here. In each set of audio, only one segment is recorded by a real person, and the rest are synthetic voices.

In this experiment, you are required to evaluate the naturalness of the audios after listening to them, and give them a score based on your evaluation. 
The experimenter allocates the following values to the scores:
Excellent=5; Good=4; Fair=3; Poor=2; Bad=1

After grading, we'd like you to give your judgment on which part of each set of audio was recorded by a human speaker. Remember to record all your evaluation scores and judgements in the provided Results.xlsx. Thank you.
